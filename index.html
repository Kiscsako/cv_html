		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p><i>23.06.29</i></p>
		<p>
			Currently, I have been working as a paramedic for the last two years. It
			is not a casual choice, since I have a BA degree in economics. It gives me
			time, to learn and sharpen my skills in various areas, such as business
			development, information technology, or healthcare. I manage my time
			efficiently, and now I have a stable financial background with a full-time
			job I enjoy.

					<h3>University of Pécs / Business and Administration</h3>
					<p>
						BA degree at the University of Pécs, I have studied economics and
						leadership as my major field. I am interested in the economy, the

					<h3>Paramedic</h3>
					<p>
						Happened by accident, I have never imagined that I am going to work
						in healthcare, especially pre-hospital. I have worked in
						administration at the Medical school, and get connected with
						interesting, also motivated people. I was genuinely interested as
						they spoke about their work, and I was open to new opportunities. I
						become a paramedic.

		<h2>Work</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<div>
					<p><i>2021 - today</i></p>
					<h3>Paramedic / OMSZ</h3>
					<p>
						A profession I love and that fits my personality. I work as a
						paramedic, helping people in their life’s worst situations. If
						accidents or serious health conditions appear, we need to stabilize
						the situation around those who are affected. Sometimes emotionally
						and physically hard, also with various events.
					</p>

			</li>
			<li>
				<div>
					<p><i>2013 - today</i></p>
					<h3>Brazilian Jiu-jitsu instructor / BJJ Pécs</h3>
					<p>
						Started as a wrestler in elementary school, I had a serious spine
						injury, so my only option was to build stronger frames, muscles, and
						skeletal systems. I started with recovery training, but then I
						needed something with more action. I choose Brazilian jiu-jitsu and
						also fell in love with it. Since I was motivated, soon I become an
						assistant coach and with years and changes in leadership at the club
						I was training, I got responsible to teach this art.
					</p>

					<h3>Administrative associative</h3>
					<p>
						I was working on the administrative tasks of various size projects.
						I was not the best fit for the position, since the work was quite
						repetitive, and I love the see the result of my work. Doing
						administrative work is what I am not suitable for.
